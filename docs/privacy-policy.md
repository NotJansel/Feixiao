# Blanketbot Privacy Policy

The developer of Allium is not a lawyer and does not have the resources to hire lawyers. I have, to the best of my ability, written this document clearly, concisely, and accurately. If you have any questions, please see the `Contact` section.

With this the only person to access the data described below is Jansel and his hosting provider.

## Data

Blanketbot uses a Database to store Channel and Guild ID's, as well as Twitch Channel names for the live notification feature. Data will be stored as long as at least 1 Server still watches for a streamer. If all servers stop watching for a streamer, the data for the respective streamer will be deleted.

## Contact

For questions, you may email me at contact@jansel.dev. You may also contact jansel on Discord.
